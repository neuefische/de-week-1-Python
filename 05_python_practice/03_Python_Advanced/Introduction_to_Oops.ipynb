    "OOPs is a way of organizing code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** An object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address, and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Alternatively, it could represent an email with properties such as a recipient list, subject, and body, as well as behaviors like adding attachments and sending.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** are called `methods` in OOP world. **Characteristics** are `attributes` (properties). Technically **attributes** are `variables` or `values` related to the state of the object whereas *methods* are `functions` which affect the attributes of the object.\n",

    " #### Advantages of OOPs:  \n",
    "- Provides a clear structure to programs\n",
    "- Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug\n",
    "- Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n",
    "- Allows you to build reusable applications with less code\n",
    "#### Disadvantages of OOPs:  \n",
    "- Difficulty in testing and debugging: \n",
    "- Designing a program using OOP principles takes more time than procedural approaches\n",
    "- Not Ideal for all problems(like small logics or scripts)\n",
    "- Complex relationships, like A single change in a parent class, can have cascading effects on all derived classes\n"

    "* **Access:** They can access only class variables (using `cls.attribute_name` or `Class.attribute_name`). They do not have access to instance-specific attributes.\n",

    "* **Purpose:** Static methods are like regular functions that happen to be defined within a class. They have no access to instance-specific data (`self`) or class-specific data (`cls`). Their primary usage is for creating helper or utility functions that logically belong to the class but don't require any specific instance or class context.\n",

    "### **1. Inheritance**  \n",
    "**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming that enables a new class, known as the child class (or subclass), to acquire properties `(attributes)` and behaviors `(methods)` from an existing class, referred to as the parent class (or superclass). This relationship is often described as an \"is-a\" relationship\n",

    " Inheritance is vital for creating organized, efficient, and extensible codebases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability:** One of the most significant benefits is the ability to reuse code. Common attributes and methods can be defined once in a parent class, and all child classes can automatically inherit and utilize them without needing to rewrite the same code. This reduces redundancy and streamlines development.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensibility:** Inheritance makes a system highly extensible. New functionalities or specialized behaviors can be easily added to child classes without altering the existing parent class code, allowing for flexible program expansion.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modeling \"Is-A\" Relationships:** It provides a clear and intuitive way to model hierarchical relationships between real-world entities. For instance, a SportsCar is a Car, and a Car is a Vehicle, creating a logical structure in the code.   \n",

    " **Private Members:** A double underscore prefix `(__)` before a member's name indicates that it is private. When an attribute or method is prefixed with `__`, Python automatically performs **\"name mangling**.\" This process alters the name of the attribute by adding an underscore and the class name to the beginning (e.g., __value in a Car class becomes _Car__value).

    "### **4. Abstraction**   \n",
    "**Abstraction** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows you to **hide internal implementation details** and show only the **relevant functionality** to the user. Think of it as a way to focus on *what an object does* rather than *how it does it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Real-Life Analogy of Abstraction\n",
    "When you drive a car, you use the **steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes**—you don’t need to know how the engine, fuel pump, or sensors work internally. That’s abstraction in action: hiding complexity and exposing only what's essential.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### **Why is it Important?**  \n",
    "Abstraction offers several significant benefits in software development:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplified Complexity:** Hides unnecessary implementation details, making systems easier to use and manage.\n",
    "* **Improved Modularity:** Promotes clean separation of concerns, making components reusable and adaptable.\n",
    "* **Reduced Errors:** Prevents misuse by hiding sensitive internals, reducing risk of bugs and data corruption.\n",
    "* **Better Security:** Limits access to internal structures, safeguarding critical logic and data.\n",

    "\n",

    "- 4. Optionally, define concrete methods for shared functionality.\n",

    "\n",
