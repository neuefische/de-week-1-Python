Write a function that takes in a string, and returns a list that holds the length of each word in the phrase, separated by an inputted delimiter (so you're function should accept two arguments again).

    "1. Let's build a calculator for figuring out how much I owe in taxes (and by calculator, I mean function). Write a function that takes in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two values, as well as an income to compute the taxes on (so your function should accept two arguments). For the tuple list, the first value of a tuple will be an income upper bound, and the second will be a tax rate for all income up to the given income bound. You need to build a calculator that will calculate the tax for all income up to each income bound (if it goes up that high) for the given tax rate. You can assume that the list of tuples will be sorted by the income bound (e.g. the first value in the tuple), such that the lowest income bound will be first, and the highest last (see below for an example).  \n",

    " As an example, let's say my tax info is `[(50000, 0.08), (100000, 0.10), (150000, 0.15)]`. This means that the first 50k of income is taxed at 8%, the second 50k at 10%, and the rest at 15% (note here that any income that comes after the 150k is taxed at 15%. Therefore, giving a highest upper bound is misleading because everything above 100k will be taxed at 15%). So, if the inputted income was 170k, then my taxes would be \n",
